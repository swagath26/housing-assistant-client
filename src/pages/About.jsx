            <p>Welcome to our Real Estate Web Application, a project built using React for the front end 
                and Django for the back end. This application serves as a comprehensive platform for 
                exploring property listings, complete with features such as multi-step forms, interactive maps, 
                and detailed property information.</p>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>

                full-stack web development. It is intended solely for educational purposes, showcasing 
                skills in modern web technologies and architecture.</p>

                real estate listings but is designed to simulate a real-world property management system.</p>
